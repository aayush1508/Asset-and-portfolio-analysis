# Asset-and-portfolio-analysis
This repository contains jupyter notebooks, python code and data sets for the project - "Asset and portfolio analysis"
The project is about building a meaningful portfolio using portfolio construction and optimization techniques. 
Assesing assets and portfolios is generally done using 2 parameters : Retrun and Risk.
I use various methods to estimate risk and return.
The various analysis done are in the portfolio_construction jupyter notebook.
The my_toolkit.py file contains the various methods and functions used for the construction.
Also I built an interactive model for the CPPI strategy which generates random scenarios and helps us guage the risk and returns. This is in the interactive_CPPI_strategy jupyter notebook.
All the data sets used here is stored in the data folder. The data sets are sourced from yahoo finance and ken French data library.
